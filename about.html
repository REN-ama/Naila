    <h2>Her name is Naila, and she is the most amazing person I've ever met.  
        She has a beautiful smile that instantly makes my day better.  
        What I love most about her is her kindness and her warm heart.
        Every little thing she does — like the way she giggles when she's excited — makes me fall for her even more.
        She is not only my girlfriend; she is my safe place, and the person I want to share every tomorrow with.
        I feel so lucky to walk this life journey hand in hand with her. <3 </h2>
